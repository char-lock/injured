INJURIES SYSTEM FOR MINECRAFT v1.19.2 + PAPER
    * On hit, players have a configurable chance to start bleeding.
      - Redstone particles would spawn on the player as they take damage.
        ? Make both damage and duration configurable.
      - Bleeding can only be stopped with a piece of paper labelled 'Bandage'
        ? Make item type and name configurable
    * After a fall of more than 5 blocks, the player should be injured.
      - Slowness would be applied.
        ? Allow multiplier to be configurable.
      - Injury can only be fixed by using a stick labelled 'Splint'
        ? Make item type and name configurable.
    * To mitigate some of the issues of using the poison effect for bleed,
      I need to add a custom modifier to ensure the player is killed rather
      than stuck at a single heart of health.
    * I also need to ensure that bleed sticks, even when the player attempts
      to use milk and/or honey to cure it.



DETECTION SYSTEM FOR MINECRAFT v1.19.2 + PAPER
    * Mob detection radius should change depending on player movement.
      - Sprinting is most detectable, walking is normal detection, crouching is low detection.
        ? Allow multipliers for each movement type to be configurable.
    * Have the mob look towards any snowball thrown into their detection radius.
      ? Allow distraction duration to be configurable.

>> Paper is built using Gradle.
>> Paper team uses IntelliJ IDEA as their IDE
>> Paper Getting Started: https://docs.papermc.io/paper/dev/project-setup

>> Create a project directory in which the build script will be edited.

>> Item.getType().name().replace("_", " ").toLowerCase() // Get the item name of a Material
>> An item only has a display name if one has been set.

>> To detect a thrown snowball, the mob would need to be looking in its radius.
>> If a snowball enters it, the mob starts moving towards it and stays at landing.
>> Starts back on normal AI after set duration.


Every time an appropriate type of damage is applied
to a player, a check is made to see if bleed will be
applied to them.

If bleed is applied to a player, a constant status
needs to be added that won't be removed by the game.

If a player drinks milk or honey, there needs to be
a check for the bleed effect, and, if it's there,
it needs to be reapplied immediately.

Default bleed duration should be Integer.MAX_VALUE.

Every time the player is damaged by poison, there
needs to be a check for the bleed flag. If it's
present, show the bleed particle effect.



Add a scheduled cull of the injuredPlayers list to see when someone on it last logged in.


player.spawnParticle(Particle.REDSTONE, where, bleedParticleCount);


>> Fix item check error.
>> Add duration.
>> Add crippling injury
>> Add "splint" as cure for crippling.
